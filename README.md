# Rock-Paper-Scissors

An html file that has a simple script to play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer using a web browser's console. The game is played in 5 rounds where each round displays the player's and computer's scores in the beginning of the round. After 5 rounds, whoever has the highest score wins the game or is a draw if both players have the same score.

The script incorporates the Math.random function to generate a randomly generated computer selection between rock paper and scissors. The game also gets user input using the window.prompt function as well as conditional statements to determine who wins the round/game.
